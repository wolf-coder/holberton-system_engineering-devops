I am a software developer and a student at Holberton School. I have developed this project as a part of my curriculum and to enhance my skills in system engineering and devops.

The project "holberton-system_engineering-devops" is a collection of exercises that cover various concepts in system engineering and devops such as shell basics, permissions, redirections, variables expansions, loops, conditions and parsing, processes and signals, regular expressions, networking basics, configuration management, SSH, web server, load balancer, HTTPS/SSL, and more. 

The journey of developing this project has been a challenging one. I started with a basic understanding of system engineering and devops and gradually built upon that knowledge by implementing various exercises on different topics. I encountered several difficulties along the way, but the most difficult one was understanding how to manage and configure servers. With the help of various resources and guidance from my peers, I was able to overcome this challenge and improve my understanding of server management.

The project includes various scripts and files that cover a wide range of topics such as shell basics, permissions, redirections, variables expansions, loops, conditions and parsing, processes and signals, regular expressions, networking basics, configuration management, SSH, web server, load balancer, HTTPS/SSL, and more. 

The project also includes a unique feature where i added a script that shows the attached IPs to a server, this feature is a great tool to understand how the IPs are attached to a server and how to manage them.

There are still some features that need to be implemented such as more advanced algorithms and more scripts. I plan to continue working on this project and adding more features in the future.

Overall, this project has been a great learning experience for me and I hope it serves as a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn about system engineering and dev
